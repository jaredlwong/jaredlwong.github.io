# Hi There!

I'm not actively looking at the moment. However, I am always on the lookout for
a great opportunity.

In any future opportunity I am looking for a compelling product that has
opportunity for growth. I am also looking for a role that would allow me to
grow.

I'm not currently interested in trading, gaming, or cryptocurrency companies.

In terms of type of work, I'm currently working on Trust and Safety (fighting
spam and unsafe content) at Pinterest, and have some related experience with
recommendation systems and infrastructure related work. I like this work since
it is really important in the broader tech industry at the moment. I'm open to
other areas outside of Trust and Safety and recommendations. If you want to
learn more about past experience you can print my resume here
[jaredlwong.com/resume](https://jaredlwong.com/resume/) and my
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredlwong/) is also up to date.

I'm currently located in SF, open to work around the Bay Area. Before COVID I
would have said I prefer to be in person, but since COVID I'm more open to
working remotely.

I am open to exploratory conversations if you think it could be helpful.
If you want to grab some time to chat I'm free at these times (I'm pretty busy
at the moment with my team, apologies in advance):
