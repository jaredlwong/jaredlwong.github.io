# Hi There!

I'm open to exploring options.

If you'd like to get time with me, please find time on here [calendly.com/jaredlwong/meeting](https://calendly.com/jaredlwong/meeting).

I'm really busy at work right now and this is the only time I can block out.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where can I find your resume? Do you have an up to date Linkedln Profile?

My resume can be found here [jaredlwong.com/resume](https://jaredlwong.com/resume/).

My [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredlwong/) is also up to date.

### How can I contact you? Email and phone number?

Please schedule a meeting with me here [calendly.com/jaredlwong/meeting](https://calendly.com/jaredlwong/meeting).

Through calendly you can choose to set up a Google Meet or Zoom meeting. You may also specify your own VC link if those don't work for you.

I prefer VC over phone calls because my phone may automatically decline your call, especially those not in my contact list. Unfortunately I had to turn this on due to a high amount of spam calls.

My email is jaredlwong@gmail.com.

### Are you open to relocation or remote work?

I'm currently located in SF. Before COVID I would have said I prefer to be in person, but since COVID I'm more open to working remotely.

### What is your work authorization status?

I am a US Citizen

### Are you interested in consulting?

Not at this time
