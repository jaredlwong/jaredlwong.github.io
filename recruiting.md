# Hi There!

I'm not actively looking at the moment. However, I am always on the lookout for
a great opportunity.

In any future opportunity I am looking for a compelling product that has
opportunity for growth. I am also looking for a role that would allow me to
grow. Some things I'm generally looking for:
- I'm not currently interested in trading, gaming, or cryptocurrency companies
- A diverse leadership team is a big plus
- Teams that align closely with the current company strategy excite me

I have 5 years of experience, all at Pinterest - I also interned at Pinterest
in 2013 and 2014 ðŸš€. I'm currently working on Trust and Safety (fighting spam
and unsafe content) at Pinterest, and through this have worked with
recommendation systems. I previously worked on our infrastructure and signal
producing teams. If you want to learn more about past experience you can print
my resume here [jaredlwong.com/resume](https://jaredlwong.com/resume/) and my
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredlwong/) is also up to date.

I'm currently located in SF, open to work around the Bay Area. Before COVID I
would have said I prefer to be in person, but since COVID I'm more open to
working remotely.

I currently work in Java, Python, and Go. In school worked with C++ - open to
these opportunities as well - but no working experience. I have 5 years of
experience with ETL workflows and Big Data frameworks including Cascading,
Hadoop, and Spark.

I am open to exploratory conversations if you think it could be helpful.
If you want to grab some time to chat I'm free at these times (I'm pretty busy
at the moment with my team, apologies in advance):
